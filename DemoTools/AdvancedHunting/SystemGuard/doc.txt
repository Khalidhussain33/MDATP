Attribute 

Data type 

Description 

TpmMachineId 

string 

Unique machine ID derived from the Attestation Identity Key (AIK). This ID changes if the AIK changes, such as when keys are cleared from TPM.  

 

SystemGuardSecurityLevel 

int 

A value from 0 to 700 that reflects the overall device security level based on the state of boot properties as attested by System Guard: 

·         0: TPM, AIK, UEFI secure boot, ELAM, or other critical features are missing or turned off. This value also applies if the device is set to boot in safe mode or WinPE, or has debugging or test modes turned on 

·         100:  No Virtualization-based security

·         200: HVCI and IOMMU off

·         250: HVCI off

·         300: IOMMU off 

·         400: DTRM off 

·         500: DTRM on 

·         700: Critical features present and turned on. SMM attestation monitoring turned on (or disabled on ARM) 

TpmVersion 

string 

Version of Trusted Platform Module (TPM) on the device 

ReportValidityStartTime 

datetime 

Date and time that marks when the boot attestation report is considered valid.  The attestation report should not be considered valid before this time. 

ReportExpirationTime 

datetime 

Expiration of the boot attestation report. This is automatically set to four days from validity start date. However, a new attestation report should automatically replace existing reports on device reboot. 

ValidationResult 

int 

Result of validation of the cryptographically signed boot attestation report. 0 means the report is valid, while any other value indicates validity errors.  

IsBootDebuggingOff 

boolean 

Indicates whether boot debugging is on or off. This should be off on secure devices.  

IsKernelDebuggingOff 

boolean 

Indicates whether kernel debugging is on or off. This should be off on secure devices. 

IsTestSigningOff 

boolean 

Indicates whether test signing at boot is on or off. This should be off on secure devices. 

IsFlightSigningOff 

boolean 

Indicates whether flight signing at boot is on or off. This should be off on secure devices 

IsDriverCodeIntegrityEnforced 

boolean 

Indicates whether the device booted with driver code integrity enforcement 

IsElamDriverLoaded 

boolean 

Indicates whether the device booted with the Early Launch Antimalware (ELAM) driver loaded 

IsSecureBootOn 

boolean 

Indicates whether the device booted with Secure Boot on 

IsIommuOn 

boolean 

Indicates whether the device booted with IOMMU on 

IsVsmOn 

boolean 

Indicates whether the device booted in virtual secure mode, i.e. with virtualization-based security (VBS) on. 

IsHvciOn 

boolean 

Indicates whether the device booted with hypervisor-protected code integrity (HVCI) 

Pcr0Hash 

string 

Cryptographic hash used by TPM for the PCR0 register, covering measurements for the Authenticated Code Module (ACM) and BIOS/UEFI modules 

WindowsBootManagerHash 

string 

Cryptographic hash of the Windows Boot Manager 

WindowsOSLoaderHash 

string 

Cryptographic hash of the Windows OS Loader 

ElamDriverHash 

string 

Cryptographic hash of the Windows Defender Early Launch Antimalware (ELAM) driver 

ElamDriverPath 

string 

Path to the Windows Defender Early Launch Antimalware (ELAM) driver binary file 

ElamDriverSigner 

string 

Signer of the Windows Defender Early Launch Antimalware (ELAM) driver binary file 

UefiSigners

string

List of signing keys used to verify the EFI boot applications, showing the GUID of the signature owner and the signature digest
